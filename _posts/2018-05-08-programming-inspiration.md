# Joe Armstrong: Forgotten Ideas in Computer Science 

I had the great fortunate of hearing Joe Armstrong’s keynote speech at [GOTO Chicago’s conference](https://gotochgo.com/). Technologically, as the author of the Erlang programming language, he’s astonishing. Personally, his keynote was just what I needed to hear. As a junior developer, surrounded by *mostly* more experienced techies, I was struggling with imposter syndrome. And Joe’s keynote reminded me why I love programming. It’s a place to be quirky, it’s a place to tackle difficult problems while incorporating what you love (for me, language & cats), and it’s a place where everyone was new once. Joe’s speech brought back all the whimsy & exploration that we probably all love about programming. Give it a watch & be inspired:
