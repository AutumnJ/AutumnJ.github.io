# Tackling Java with a New Acquaintance 

I recently interviewed with a company that adheres to the [extreme programming (XP)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/) methodology. It's a part of the agile framework, and emphasizes pair programming as a means of producing higher quality code in a more timely fashion. 

While I've pair programmed before, the meeting was my first experience pair programming in an interview setting, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Any time I can write code, conceptualize code or discuss code, I immediately feel more at ease. And writing code alongside someone more knowledgeable, who is focused on helping you produce high-quality code made for an incredibly encouraging interview experience. It reminded me of one of the tenets of improv - "You can look good if you make your partner look good." Not only did a walk away with a greater respect for the company and its process, but I learned a lot about the language and testing framework we used. 

During the interview, I functioned as the *navigator*, reviewing the code, and providing ideas and direction for what we would tackle next. The interviewer acted as the *driver*, and wrote the code and tests. Since it was still an interview setting, I tried to be intentional about displaying knowledge I already possessed or gained through research in preparation for the interview. With that in mind, I focused on asking clarifying questions that revealed my existing knowledge. For instance,

> JavaScript has an `indexOf()` method, is there something equivalent we could use here? If not, we could use a `for` loop to identify the element we're looking for.

The company also focused on Test Driven Development (TDD), which actually made writing the code easier. Once I had identified potential test cases, and the driver had written the code to facilitate those tests, I'd had enough time to think through potential approaches and articulate a plan of attack to pass the failing tests. 

Throughout the interview, the largest hurdle was identifying elements to refactor, in part because I was less familiar with the language. I could have done a better job of asking clarifying questions to clear up those grey areas more quickly. But after the first pass at refactoring, I became more familiar with identifying elements that were repetitive or could easily break and were good candidates for refactoring. 

From that experience, I walked away with the belief that the XP methodology does foster [communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/). And, even if I don't work in a company that adheres to that methodology, I hope to find on that values those components.
