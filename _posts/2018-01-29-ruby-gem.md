# Ruby CLI Scraper Gem 

I published my first ruby gem! In keeping with the theme of my ~~life~~ blog, I chose something pet-oriented, and built a command line interface that gathers inputs from the user, scrapes a website and supplies the user with a list of dogs or cats available for adoption in their area. In theory, so much fun. I dreamt of all the ascii kitties I could scatter throughout my code. But when I started working on it, I had little time for ascii critters! 

There were a couple tough points throughout the project:






Since you're eager to get started, you can find the gem on [ruby gems] (https://rubygems.org/gems/pets_seeking_people) or find info on my [GitHub repo] (https://github.com/AutumnJ/AutumnJ-cli-app). Please use, contribute, adopt pets & have all the fun. 

Below is a short video about the gem, for your viewing fun.
